# Dockerized Laravel

This is my attempt at putting together a docker container to set up a production environment for Laravel.

You can access Adminer at `localhost:8080` with the username, password and database of `laravel`.

If you have trouble conneccting to the database, change the values of `.env` in `content` to reflect the postgres database setup.

You can access an instance of AWS Cloud9 at `localhost:8000`.

Enjoy ☆彡
