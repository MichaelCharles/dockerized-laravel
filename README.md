# Dockerized Laravel

This is the build branch of my Dockerized Laravel project. It contains the Dockerfiles and related files needed to build the images used by my Dockerized Laravel project. These images are available [on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/mcaubrey/).

It's much faster to run the way it is set up on the `master` branch. 

This is my attempt at putting together a docker container to set up a development environment for Laravel.

You can access Adminer at `localhost:8080`. If you have trouble connecting to the database, change the values of `.env` in `content` to reflect the postgres database setup. You can access an instance of Cloud9 at `localhost:8000`.

Enjoy ☆彡
